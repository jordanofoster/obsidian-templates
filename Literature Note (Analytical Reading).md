## Analytical Reading

### Stage 1 - Defining Structure

#### Classify the material according to kind (theoretical/practical) and subject.
<!-- Use tags if necessary -->

#### Summarize the overarching theme(s) of the work.

#### How does the work's structure and relation thereof convey its themes?

#### What questions/problems does the author intend to solve?

### Stage 2 - Deciphering Meaning

#### List any important passages or sentences that collectively construct the author's main points.

#### Based on the previous findings - what arguments are made, and what conclusions are reached?

#### What solutions does the author propose?

### Stage 3 - Judgement

> Preliminary checks:
- [ ] I understand that I must have **fully understood the source material** before proceeding.

I have decided to reach the following decision:
- [ ] I **agree**
- [ ] I **disagree** on one of the following grounds:
	- [ ] The author is [[20221020201300#^cd1b87|uninformed]].
	- [ ] The author is [[20221020201300#^6302d9|misinformed]].
	- [ ] The author is [[20221020201300#^a19caf|illogical]].
- [ ] I will **abstain from judgement** on the basis of [[20221020201300#^0bd28d|insufficient analysis]] for the following reason:
	- [ ] There are questions left unanswered
	- [ ] The knowledge at the author's disposal was underutilised
		- [ ] Not all implications/consequences of the author's knowledge were considered
	- [ ] The conclusions made are irrelevant to their problems/questions

#### Given prior analysis, explain why you have reached this conclusion.
